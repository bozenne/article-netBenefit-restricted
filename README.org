This directory is organized as follows:
- *the BATCH_SIMULATION files* define the simulation studies. Each
  file was excecuted 10 times using a different id and therefore a
  different seed when randomly generating the data. The output of the
  simulations were saved in a =Results= directory and the trace of the
  execution of the R code can be found in the =output= directory.
  
- *the SUBM_SIMULATION files* are used to run the batch files via a
  queuing system.

- *the BUILD files* gather the results of the various simulations by
  reading the data in the =Results= directory and export them in the
  =Results= folder. 

- *the FIGURE files* TO BE WRITTEN
  
- *the TABLE files* TO BE WRITTEN

Note: . Then the file
  =BUILD_graphtable.R= read these results and generate all figures and
  tables and save them in the directories =figures= and =tables= (not
  used in the article). Imports functions defined in =FCT-gg.R=.
